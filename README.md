Building Planning Project
Description

The Building Planning Tool is a Windows Forms application designed for planning multi-purpose buildings. It allows users to create, manage, and modify buildings, floors, and rooms while providing vital information such as design loads, volumes, and furnishing details. This tool is intended to support project planners, structural engineers, and interior designers in the design and analysis phases of building construction projects.

Features

Create and Manage Building Elements: Add, modify, and delete buildings, floors, and rooms through an interactive graphical interface.

Define Area Usage: Assign specific usage types (e.g., offices, apartments, restaurants) to rooms, and calculate the corresponding design loads.

Volume and Load Calculation: Calculate the volume of slabs for quick material estimation and determine the design load per area based on usage.

Furnishing Details: Display information on furnishing items like tables and chairs for better interior design planning.

Serialization Support: Save and load building data with serialization to ensure data persistence between sessions.

Cost Summary and Inventory: Generate a cost summary of concrete slab costs and provide an inventory of furnishing items for the entire building.
